# LastFM CLI

This gem utilizes the `https://www.last.fm/api/show/chart.getTopTracks` endpoint from last.fm to display the top 50 music tracks in the api. The user can list the songs, display individual song details, and add a selected song to the current playlist.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'last_fm_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install last_fm_cli

## Usage

Run `./bin/last_fm_cli` to initiate the last.fm cli

Enter `tracks` to display the list of the current top 50 tracks in the music chart.
  - Enter a number 1 to 50 to select a song from the list.
  - After selecting a number, enter `add song` to add the song to the current playlist.
  - To reset the currently selected song, enter `tracks`.
Enter `playlist` to display the current list of songs in the playlist.
Enter `artists` to display the artists that are currently featured in the music chart.
  - Enter `exit` to quit the program.


## Development
